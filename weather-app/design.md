# Design Case Study

## The Process

The first thing I wanted to do was to learn more about the requirements of the application and
really dive deep into what it means to be this certain demographic. I then understood that the
application had to be simple enough for the target users.

I didn't want to over complicated the task. This lead to my goal of making something
simple and easy to understand.

## The Aesthetics

The design choices I made is based upon what others did or what designs came before me. Online,
I researched many websites such as weather.com, and local news stations, and went about how they
displayed data to thier users.

Though the API given had descriptions that could be more in detail. Most of what I seen.
data has been kept straight to the point for easy readabilty to the users. So I wanted
to make sure to pick and choose the correct information from the API.

### Colors

The colors of the website, I wanted to choose warm and summer like theme colors. In Costal Flordia,
it rains alot in summer, and it gets hot. I found the colors to be representing of Florida, and summer.
I also added a wave as a background to represent rain, and to fit with my SEO writing content.

## The Payoff.

In the end the application was a good insight of what an weather app needs to be about
and what information should it display. I learned a lot from completing this project and
there are many changes I would like to make, going back, but I think overally I am statsifed.
