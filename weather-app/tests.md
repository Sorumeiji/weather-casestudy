# Test Variations

During the creation of the web application, at least two varaitions has been on my mind.
Design wise and development wise. One varation that is design based and one that
could be more optimal for development.

## Design

For design I would had structured the order of information better for the user.
I would had place the weather on top or at least at the focus point of the application.
Users want to see the weather and know it really fast.

I believe by changing the order of information displayed. This will not only increase
clicks, but it early on gives users a preview of the application before the download.

## Development

For development I would like this application code to be more simplified. I felt like there
are some parts in my code I could combine togethor, such as daily and hourly. Also,
I feel like added a pagnation to the application would had been helpful for length control
when displaying the data of hourly and daily. This helping the users as well.
